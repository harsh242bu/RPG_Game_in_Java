Design selection approach: Merged the design of both team members. Hybrid Approach

Reason for merging design:
After careful evaluation of both designs. We identified that some aspects of game implementation are better implemented
in member 1 design and others are better implemented in member 2 design. So we decided to merge both designs. For ex:
Game data and game setup was well organized and easy to follow in Harsh's design. Yan has a board implementation
along with movement logic which was loosely coupled.

Analysis of Harsh's old design:
    A flaw in my old game design was the distribution of responsibility with respect to market and various cells
    in the game. Cell architecture and market architecture was kind of overlapping each other in terms of responsibility.
    So we adopted the cell/tile architecture from Yan's design. And resolved the responsibility issue in the new game

Analysis of Yan's old design:


Harsh design pieces:
    Game setup
    Game data
    State machines
    Battle abstraction
    Attack abstraction

Yan design pieces:
    Tile architecture
    Game board
    Position
    Movement abstraction
    Market tile

Important implementation points -
1. We design the location as a class to link the player and the board. Because by doing this, the board and player
    are not depend on each other which reduces the coupling.
2. We design the factories and use clone to copy the object. Because this can save our time when creating new objects
    with complicated arguments.
3. We design the controller to move the characters on the map. Because this distinguish the moving and other action.
4.

Summary - By implementing the hybrid approach we eliminated flaws from both the design. The new design is much more robust
            and extendable. This new design meets our expectation for the new Legends of Valor game.
